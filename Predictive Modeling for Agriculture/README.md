# modeling-for-agriculture
a multi-class Logistic Regression model to predict categories of "crop" with a F1 score of more than 0.5.

# Measuring the essential soil metrics
(N,P,K & pH) can be an expensive and time-consuming hence I used each feature to predict the crop. I did this to find out the best features to prioritize. Potassium(K) yielded the highest score, P being the second best.

# Can do more on this project
The data can be scaled to improve the model.
